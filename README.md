# File Hash Comparator

The File Hash Comparator is a simple web application designed to help users verify the integrity of two files by comparing their hash values. This tool takes two files as input and calculates their SHA-256 hash values to determine if they are identical. If the files have the same hash, it confirms that the files are identical; otherwise, it indicates that the files differ.
